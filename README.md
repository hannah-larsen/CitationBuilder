# Citation Builder
Creating a program that auto-generates a string sequence for various citation styles to practice my Python skills.

## Usage
Run this program in your terminal by typing
`run CitationBuilder.py` and a series of prompts should appear in your terminal. Ensure you are following the correct format in which the program is asking,
otherwise you will be asked to go back and re-fill it to be in the correct format.
After all the inputs are obtained for the citation, the program will output the citation, and the user can then copy + paste this and use it elsewhere.
